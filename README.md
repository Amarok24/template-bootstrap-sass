# template-bootstrap-sass
An optimised starter template for Bootstrap 5 and Sass (SCSS).

Demo: https://amarok24.github.io/template-bootstrap-sass/

The HTML page is fully accessible via keyboard. Use "ESC" for opening the navigation, "TAB" for switching between sections, "ENTER" for action.

## How to set up locally
Click the "Use this template" button on the GitHub page to create your own copy directly in GitHub.

Or clone via git. Be sure you have git and Node.js installed. Then run:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Amarok24/template-bootstrap-sass.git
```

(An alternative way without using git is to download this repository as a ZIP file.)

Then enter the created directory and install all dependencies (Bootstrap...) with:
```sh
npm install
```
